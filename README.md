Stateless many-time detection and characterization of Merkle-Tree short-read genome-to-reference sequence verification and alignment; safe read, search, and query in adversarial networks comprised of spliced WOTS transcriptome-as-signatures zero-knowledge batch processiong i.e: 3.2 billion letters in the DNA sequence mapped with a Mummer-Invariant Splice-Junction (Pseudo Josephson Junctions) Artin Verifier. Donor and Acceptor sentinel trees emerge wherein 'hidden-learning modules' greedily search for matching palindromic mappings of rna-seq and distribute a federated batch signing method to reduce the key size.

This software aims to optimize a counterexample of Grover's algorithm aimed at aligning contiguous pseudogenes (similar to virtual particles) using splice junction loci as an immutable distributed topology of topologies - a Homomorphic Hypertree.

Example:

Sign a mappable-read as a Message M with HORS: 

H(M) = 28c5c.....

H(M)is an encrypted pyrosequence:

H(M) = {2, 8, c, 5, c, ...} then seed a PRNG (Pseudo probability random function) of Maximal Exact Matches indel-indices. The seeds from the mates of paired-end RNA-seq reads are thus clustered and stitched in concurrent form. 

Authentication nodes enter a distributed chimeric alignment raft consensus (see: yosi.rst) of transcriptome genome trees which containes {key,value} validates spliced palindromic alignment in Trillions of Illumina reads per batch.
