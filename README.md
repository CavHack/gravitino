Stateless many-time detection and characterization of spliced WOTS transcriptome-as-signatures Secret key hashing. Mummer-Invariant Splice-Junction (Pseudo Josephson Junctions) Artin Verifier. Donor and Acceptor sentinel learning modules search for matching palindromic mapping of rna-seq.

This software aims to optimize a counterexample of Grover's algorithm aimed at aligning contiguous pseudogenes (similar to virtual particles) using splice junction loci as an immutable distributed topology of topologies. Sign a mappable read as a Message M with HORS: 

H(M) = 28c5c.....

H(M)is an encrypted pyrosequence:

H(M) = {2, 8, c, 5, c, ...} then seed a PRNG (Pseudo probability random function) PORS->HORS
